					<h2>JavaScript vs. Ruby: Looping</h2>
					<h4>March 28, 2016</h4>
				</header>
				<div class="blogentry">
					<p> Both JavaScript and Ruby allow for code blocks to be looped, or repeated indefinitely (or until some condition is met). JavaScript allows for two different type of loops, the for loop and the while loop. For loops go through a block of code multiple times, and they can also be executed to loop through the properties of an object (a JavaScript element similar to a Ruby hash) using <code>for x in object</code> syntax. While loops are similar to for loops, except that they continue to execute a code block only as long as a certain condition is true. A variation on the while loop is the do/while loop, which executes a code block once <em>before</em> checking to see if a condition is true, and then repeats the block as long as that condition is true. For both for and while loops, the condition is enclosed in parentheses and the code block to execute is enclosed in curly braces.</p>
					<br>
					<p> Ruby also offers for and while loops that function in much the same way as JavaScript loops, although parentheses and curly braces are not necessary in Ruby syntax (nevertheless, loops, like all Ruby statements, must end with an <code>end</code> statement). But Ruby also allows for additional types of loops. There is a simple loop that uses the keyword <code>loop</code> and creates an infinite loop (although it can be made finite with the ue of additional keywords like <code>break</code>, <code>redo</code>, and <code>next</code>). There is an until loop, which is sort of the opposite of a while loop; it only executes code if a specific condition is <em>false</em>. There are case statements, which test on a condition, and then execute a block of code based on which of a selection of possible values that condition evaluates to. These are most useful in applications like assigning a letter grade to a given numerical grade, where you have a wide variety of potential inputs but only a few possible outputs. Ruby can also iterate through objects using methods, while JavaScript cannot. Among those methods is .each, which can be combined with do to iterate over multiple elements in an array, hash, or range. There are still other frequently-used methods, including .map and .collect, which can prove useful. </p>
