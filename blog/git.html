    <h2>Technical Blog: Version Control</h2>

      <p>
        Version control, using a service like git, is an important tool for programmers. Version control allows for developers to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. Developers use version control in order to be able to track changes made to code, separate out (and branch off) changes made to different features, and work on different versions of the code at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
          Git helps developers track changes by allowing them to create "save points" for their code, known as commits. Each time a change is made to code, a developer can create a new commit in git, while still retaining all of the previous commits. That way, if there is some kind of error, the developer can just revert to a previous version rather than having to root out the error before continuing with any other work.
      </p>
      <p>
          Developers should use GitHub to store their code because GitHub makes that code available for any other GitHub user to see, download, and work on. That way, multiple users can work on the same code at the same time, and use their own experimentation to engage in a sort of dialogue with the developer and perhaps persuade developers to incorporate new features into their code.
