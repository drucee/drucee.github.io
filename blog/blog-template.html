<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? Because I turned in this assignment late, I was unable to pair on it. However, I found the previous assignment in pair HTML page creation quite interesting, as it forced me to share control on a project I would normally do solo. It was also a helpful exercise, as my pairing partner was able to fill in knowledge gaps that I might have had.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? I found wireframing to be helpful in that I didn't have to start writing code out of nowhere when it came time to create my HTML page. I referred to the wireframe constantly to help me figure out which elements needed to go on my HTML page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? I decided that a good wireframe should be clear and concise, without much content to clutter it up. A good wireframe should also have a "boxified" design; that is, every element should be a rectangle or box, because that is how HTML displays things. 
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I learned several of the HTML5 semantic elements, including <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and <section>.
