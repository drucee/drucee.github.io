			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Born in Michigan and raised in northern New Jersey and Memphis, TN, I'm a 31-year-old student in the Fiery Skippers cohort at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in New York City. In 2006, I graduated from the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> with a BA in Linguistics and extensive additional coursework in geography. During and after my BA I also worked on several projects in Geographic Information Systems, including making maps of new residential construction on Chicago's Near Northwest Side, <a href="https://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu/entering-cultural-communities-diversity-and-change-nonprofit-arts">geotagging</a> membership rolls of arts organizations throughout the Chicagoland area, and doing site visits to collect geographic and demographic data for a major restaurant chain. Although I wanted to continue working in GIS, I found that I could not advance in the field without knowledge of programming and databases, and so decided to explore other options.</p>
			<p> In 2007 I became a paralegal at a small immigration law firm in the Chicago Loop, and went to law school at the <a href="http://law.umn.edu">University of Minnesota Law School</a> the following year. I graduated with my Juris Doctor degree in 2011, and was admitted to the State Bar of New York in 2012. After practicing law for four years in Nashville, TN and New York City, I decided to enroll in DBC with the hope of learning the programming and Web development skills necessary to work with geodata again. </p>
			<p> I currently live in Astoria, in the borough of Queens in New York City. My interests include eating my way through the borough, learning languages (I speak French, Norwegian, and a little German), pwning at <a href="http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/041104/triviachamp.shtml">trivia</a>, and singing <a href="http://fasola.org">Sacred Harp</a> music.</p>
